      - New Dist::Zilla stuff.
      - The test suite now uses Test::Fatal instead of Test::Exception (Karen

0.05  2009-09-22
      - Switched the order of the arguments to the alias function. Existing
        code should continue to work, with a warning, for now. This will be
        removed sometime in the future.
      - Fixed calling a wrong method when trying to throw an error.

0.04  2009-09-21
      - Aliases should get the package name of the class they're defined in,
        not of the class where the aliased method is from

0.03  2009-09-08
      - Do aliasing correctly - use late binding so aliases that get overridden
        in subclasses work properly

0.02  2009-09-03
      - Attribute aliases now also allow the alias to be used as a constructor
        argument

      - Initial release
