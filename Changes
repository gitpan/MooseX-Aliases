Revision history for MooseX::Aliases

0.06  12/04/2009
    Aliased init_args now work for immutable classes.

0.05  9/22/2009
    Switched the order of the arguments to the alias function. Existing code
    should continue to work, with a warning, for now. This will be removed
    sometime in the future.
    Fixed calling a wrong method when trying to throw an error.

0.04  9/21/2009
    Aliases should get the package name of the class they're defined in, not
    of the class where the aliased method is from

0.03  9/08/2009
    Do aliasing correctly - use late binding so aliases that get overridden in
    subclasses work properly

0.02  9/03/2009
    Attribute aliases now also allow the alias to be used as a constructor
    argument

0.01  8/15/2009
    Initial release
